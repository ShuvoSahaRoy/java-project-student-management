# Requirements and Tools:
I did this project on Netbeans IDE.

You check this on your side. But You need to add two jar file. Make sure your my sql server is running and don't forget to import sql file on your "MySql server"

* mysql-connector-java-8.0.12.jar
* rs2xml.jar

Don't forget to resolve those issue by adding jar files.
